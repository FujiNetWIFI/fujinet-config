Maybe have common .h files at the top-level? For example, everyone has to have the same function definitions in screen.h (its like an interface), 
so why not make that common.. then at the individual system folder level each screen.c would include "../screen.h", 
and then their own (if necessary), such as "screen_atari.h" with functions only they need.

    "last thing I noticed, theres an option to configure wifi as disabled in fnconfig.ini. if wifi is disabled, config should skip the scan and not allow entry to a tnfs server."
