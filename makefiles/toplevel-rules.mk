# Pattern rule to support "make <platform>/<target>" syntax.
#
# Example: "make apple2/r2r"
#   $@   = "apple2/r2r"         (the full target name)
#   $(@D) = "apple2"             (the directory part before the slash)
#   $(@F) = "r2r"                (the filename part after the slash)
#
# This runs the corresponding platform makefile:
#   make -f makefiles/platforms/apple2.mk r2r
#
# Works for ANY target name, so:
#   make coco/clean   -> runs clean in makefiles/platforms/coco.mk
#   make atari/debug  -> runs debug in makefiles/platforms/atari.mk
